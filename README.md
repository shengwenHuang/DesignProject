# DesignProject
The ​Pre-Operative Assessment Clinic (​POAC​) application is a digital platform to screen patients prior to their operation and identify those that are more complex and who may need a ​POAC ​appointment and/or Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) involvement.


It was developed by UCL Design Module’s Team 9 - Jonathan Choi, Nishchal Sen, and Sheng-Wen Huang - in conjunction with the Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (TST). Currently, pre-operative assessments are conducted in hospital and take around 45 minutes. This is an inefficient use of patient and staff time. The ​POAC ​application is designed to be taken at home or in hospital with or without supervision.


Team 9 built a web and mobile app. The web app was built using Angular and is designed for use by NHS staff to manage assessment questions and generate reports of assessment and feedback results. The mobile app was built using Ionic and is designed for use by patients to view their assessment history and submit feedback. Both apps use Node.js to interface with an SQL database built using MySQL.


The project achieved all of the “Must Have” and “Should Have” requirements. Three of the seven “Could Have” requirements were removed during development (see ​Requirements ​section for further details). During the project inception stage, we agreed that the project would not involve addition of Nurse/HCA-input details such as blood test results; would not have gender-specific questions; and would not create or record patient appointments themselves.


Despite fulfilling the necessary requirements, our project does not, as yet, interface with the NHS records system MAXIMS, therefore further work is necessary to deploy the project to a live environment.
